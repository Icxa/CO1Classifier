RELEASES

December 4, 2017 - 

The latest release can be downloaded from here:
https://github.com/terrimporter/CO1Classifier/releases/tag/v2.0
The CO1v2_trained.tar.gz file should be decompressed and used directly with the RDP Classifier to make taxonomic assignments to the species rank.

The reference files for the latest release can be downloaded from here:
https://github.com/terrimporter/CO1Classifier/releases/tag/v2.0-ref
The CO1v2_training.tar.gz file should be decompressed.  The folder contains the original taxonomy and fasta files that are included here for reference only.  They were originally mined from GenBank in August 2016.

The original release described in Porter & Hajibabaei (2017) can be downloaded from here:
https://github.com/terrimporter/CO1Classifier/releases/tag/v1.0
The CO1v1_trained.tar.gz file should be decompressed and used directly with the RDP Classifier to make taxonomic assignments to the genus rank.

The reference files for the original release described in Porter & Hajibabaei (2017) can be downloaded from here:

HOW TO USE

Decompress the tar.gz file:

$ tar -xvzf FileName.tar.gz

Use with the RDP classifier:

java -Xmx8g -jar /path/to/rdp_classifier_2.12/dist/classifier.jar classify -t /path/to/CO1version_trained/rRNAClassifier.properties -o ClassifiedQueryFilename QueryFilename
